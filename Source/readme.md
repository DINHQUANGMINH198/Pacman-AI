There are several uninformed search strategies that can be implemented to help Pacman find its way from the initial location to the food location. Some of the most common ones include:

Breadth-First Search (BFS): This algorithm explores all the neighboring nodes of the initial location before moving on to the next level of nodes. This approach ensures that Pacman finds the shortest path to the food location.

Depth-First Search (DFS): This algorithm explores the deepest node in the graph first and backtracks whenever it reaches a dead-end. DFS can find a path to the food location quickly, but it may not always find the shortest path.

Uniform-Cost Search (UCS): This algorithm expands the node with the lowest cost so far. The cost is determined by the sum of the edge weights or the path cost. This algorithm can find the shortest path to the food location, but it can be slow if there are many paths with similar costs.

Iterative Deepening Search (IDS): This algorithm performs a depth-first search with a maximum depth limit. If the food location is not found within the depth limit, the algorithm increases the limit and continues the search. IDS can find the shortest path and uses less memory than BFS.

The choice of which algorithm to use depends on the specific requirements of the problem and the constraints of the system. For example, if memory is a concern, DFS or IDS may be a better choice, while if finding the shortest path is the top priority, BFS or UCS may be more appropriate.
